<h1>About Unredactor</h1>


<p>An interactive app to edit and play with words! You can redact and enter text now with this new app! The app is made to interact with the text and redact words etc. This was created by four students during the summer as their internship to create something super interesting and fascinating!</p>

<p>Here is our intro to the team who created this app!</p>
<p><strong>Hope Yim:</strong> an upcoming senior in Camas High School introduced to computer science and code. She helped with the HTML/CSS of the app and the visual structure.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler Gee:</strong> an upcoming junior in Camas High School with experience in computer science and developed the first features of the app!</p>

<p><strong>Julian McOmie:</strong> an upcoming junior in Camas High School with background in technology and computer science. Tyler and Julian developed the API* </p>

<p><strong>Alex Kari:</strong>
